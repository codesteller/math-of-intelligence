# 🧠 Math Behind Intelligence (MBI 101)
### *Foundations of Machine Learning & Robotics*

**Tagline:** *The mathematical intuition that powers perception, learning, intelligence and motion.*

---

## 🎯 Course Overview
**Total Duration:** 20 hours  
**Structure:** 3 Units → 10 Modules (≈2 hours each)  
**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python / NumPy  
**Pedagogical Style:**  
Inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) — emphasizing **visual intuition, storytelling, and geometry-based understanding** over rote derivation.

**Outcome:** Build the mathematical foundation that leads into  
**MBI 201 – Applied Math for ML & Robotics** and **MBI 301 – Advanced Math Tools for Intelligent Systems.**

## 🧩 Course Design Philosophy

*Mathematics Behind Intelligence (MBI 101)* follows a **“see → feel → derive → apply”** progression inspired by 3Blue1Brown’s approach:  
- **See:** Visualize concepts in space (vectors, gradients, surfaces).  
- **Feel:** Build geometric and physical intuition.  
- **Derive:** Formalize with equations.  
- **Apply:** Code and experiment to see it in action in ML/robotic contexts.  

Each concept connects back to **how machines perceive, learn, or move**.

## 🧠 Capstone Mini-Project
**Title:** *Simulating Learning in a Noisy World*  
**Objective:** Combine core math ideas to demonstrate how machines “learn.”  

**Tasks:**
- Represent data as vectors (Linear Algebra)  
- Add Gaussian noise (Probability)  
- Use gradient descent to minimize loss (Calculus)  
- Visualize how learning emerges from math  

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
After completing **MBI 101**, learners will:
- Visualize and interpret mathematical structures geometrically.  
- Connect abstract math to real-world intelligence (learning & control).  
- Build confidence to approach deeper applied math (MBI 201).  
- Develop a 3Blue1Brown-like *intuition-first mindset* for all future ML/robotics work.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Environment
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SymPy, SciPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Optional: PyTorch (for gradient illustration)  
- **Optional Visualization Reference:** [Manim library](https://www.manim.community/) — the same animation engine used by 3Blue1Brown.
